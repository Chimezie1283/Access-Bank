            <h2>THE WEB AND HTML</h2>
            <p>The web is a collection of documents written in <strong>HTML</strong> along with other resources such as; Images, videos as well as other programs that interacts with these documents and resources.</p>
            <p>The web is a <i>Hyertext System. That is a form of text in which documents can refer(link) to other resources</i></p>
            <br>
            <strong>NOTE:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>A web browser is an application like Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge etc. that is designed for displaying web pages</li>
                <li>Web pages are usually stored on servers</li>
                <li>The statement that <i>A server is a special compuetr that is totally different from your personal computer</i> is not true</li>
                <li>The statement that <i>All of the things you see on the web page have to be stored on the same server</i>is false. Different parts of a web page can be saved on different server</li>
                <li>To load a web page, your browser sends a request of that page to a server</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Browsers get web pages by communicating with servers over the internet. Servers are just normal computers and are not different from our convertional computers. They just have programs running on them that answers web requests.
            </p>
            <h3>Secured Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTPS)</h3>
            <p>This is simply the rule by which web browsers and servers work or interacts (sends and recieve feedbacks). Starting a web link with <i>https://www.google.com</i> tells the browser how to talk to the server. I.e which rules (or protocol) to use when talking to the web server</p>
            <p>Hepertext markup language (HTML) is the language that provides the structre and text of web pages.</p>

                <li><trong>Formalism:</trong>This is a simple fact that computers are literal not stupid. Computer take instructions word by words and don't guess. It can only do what you tell it to</li>
                <li><strong>Nesting:</strong>This is how some bits of codes can go into other bits of codes in an ordeerly way.</li>
